Time keeping for working on jobs. Originally created to keep track of time working on a job where I was working remote.

Current usage:
./timekeeper
	Start counting and display the time that has been done so far during the day. To stop counting just type done.
./timekeeper times
	Output all the time blocks that have been done and how much time worked each day.



Future plans: Make this a simple GUI program using GTK (gtkmm).
GUI Design will include start stop button and a clock, along with a display for times that have been done.
